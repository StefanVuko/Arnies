## Requirements for project

### Must

1. ~~The backend (BE) of the system must be an individual component.~~
2. ~~The frontend (FE) of the system must be an individual component implemented using HTML5, CSS and JS.~~
3. ~~The communication between FE and BE components must be implemented using HTTP(S).~~
4. ~~The communication between FE and BE components must be implemented using asynchronous data transfer (AJAX).~~
5. ~~The HTTP endpoints of the BE component must return the data either as JSON or as XML.~~
6. ~~The HTTP endpoints of the BE component must manage resources using HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, each method at least on one HTTP endpoint.~~
7. ~~The HTTP endpoints of the FE component must consume resources using HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE from at least one HTTP endpoint.~~
8. ~~The system must consume a least one external REST web service.~~
9. ~~The system must implement session management (Login, sessionID, JWT, ...).~~

### Should

10. ~~The system should consume a least two external REST web services.~~
